# Fibre Clone

This is a _[fibre.ng](https://fibre.ng)_ cloned website showing
`A better way to rent in Lagos`. It's not a full clone of the original website
because of copyright reasons but contains important features.

## Replicated Features

-   Responsive design
-   Layout of the original website
-   Absence of scroll bar at the side of the website
-   Custom Dropdown menu with just css on the first section

## Languages Used

-   HTML5
-   CSS3

## Why I used them

I used the languages above to perfect my **CSS** skill, mainly _responsive
design_ and _cloning a website to look close to it_

## Issues I'm aware of and hope to fix

-   The responsive design is not perfect
-   The whole website breaks at around 264px

## How to install and run the project

-   Fork the project and clone it to your local machine

```bash
git clone <repo>
```

-   Redirect to the _index.html_ file on your browser or use live server to
    start the project
