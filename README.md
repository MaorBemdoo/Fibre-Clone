# Fibre Clone

### This is a _[fibre.ng](https://fibre.ng)_ cloned website showing `A better way to rent in Lagos`. It's not a full clone of the original website but contains important features.

## Replicated Features

<h3>
  <li>Responsive design</li>
  <li>Layout of the original website</li>
  <li>Absence of scroll bar at the side of the website</li>
  <li>Custom Dropdown menu with just css on the first section</li>
</h3>

## Languages Used

### HTML5

### CSS3

## Why I used them

### I used the languages above to perfect my **CSS** skill, mainly _responsive design_ and _cloning a website to look close to it_

## Issues I'm aware of and hope to fix

<h3>
  <li>The responsive design is not perfect</li>
  <li>The second section with a caption <b>Explore by neighbourhood</b> breaks at around 1148px of the screen</li>
  <li>The whole website shrinks at around 862px</li>
</h3>
